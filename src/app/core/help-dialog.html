      Quick Crypt encrypts and decrypts text using a password you provide. Quick
      Crypt uses cryptographic features built into modern browsers and ensures that
      your password, clear text, and even encrypted cipher armor
      <b>do not unexpectedly traverse the internet.</b> After loading Quick Crypt,
      you could disable all networking and continue encrypting and decypting text.
      A typical use is to encrypt text before storing or sending it through an
      untrusted channel. Your original text can only be retrieved by someone who knows
      the password you used during encryption. Remember your password, or you won't be
      able to retrieve the original text either.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use Quick Crypt, paste or load the text you want to encrypt into the
      field on the left labeled <i>Enter Clear Text</i>, then click the
      <b>Encrypt</b> button and enter a password. You can enter an optional
      password hint to remind yourself which password you used. The hint is stored
      in the clear with the encrypted text, so don't make it too revealing. The
      encrypted results are displayed to the right and can be copied or saved to
      disk. To decrypt information previously encrypted with Quick Crypt, paste or
      load the encrypted armor text in the field on the right labeled
      <i>Enter Cipher Armor</i> and click the <b>Decrypt</b> button. If you've
      forgotten your password, you are out of luck unless you have access to a
      supercomputer and lots of time to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can customize encryption options within the
      <i>Advanced Encryptions Options</i> panel. Other than
      your password choice, Quick Crypt does not provide options known to be
      insecure, so adjusting settings is safe. If you want even more
      security, you can encrypt clear text multiple times with the
      <i>Loop Encrypt</i> option; just be sure to use a different password for
      each loop.
