      Quick Crypt encrypts and decrypts text using a password you provide. Quick
      Crypt uses cryptographic features built into modern browsers and ensures that
      your password, clear text, and even encrypted cipher armor
      <b>do not unexpectedly traverse the internet.</b> After loading Quick Crypt,
      you could disable all networking and continue encrypting and decypting text.
      A typical use is to encrypt text before storing or sending it through an
      untrusted channel. Your original text can only be retrieved by someone who knows
      the password you used during encryption. Remember your password, or you won't be
      able to retrieve the original text either.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have used Quick Crypt previously on this device or another you should
      select <i>Use and existing Quick Crypt Passkey</i> below. You must use the same
      Passkey to decrypt messages that was used to encrypt them. 
      a new passkey, it 
      You can customize encryption options within the
      <i>Advanced Encryptions Options</i> panel. Other than
      your password choice, Quick Crypt does not provide options known to be
      insecure, so adjusting settings is safe. If you want even more
      security, you can encrypt clear text multiple times with the
      <i>Loop Encrypt</i> option; just be sure to use a different password for
      each loop.
