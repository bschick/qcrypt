    <div *ngIf="!error">
      <p>Use recovery to regain access to your user identity when you have lost
        or damaged your Quick Crypt passkeys. Recovery removes your existing
        passkeys from Quick Crypt and creates a new one. You should also
        delete the removed passkeys from your passkey management tool. Once
        your new passkey is created, you can again decrypt cipher text
        using your encryption passwords.
      </p>
      <p *ngIf="currentUserName && !authenticated">
        There is an existing Quick Crypt user on this system called <b>"{{currentUserName}}"</b>.
        Instead of starting the recovery process, you may want to try
        <a href="javascript:void(null);" role="button" (click)="onClickSignin()">
          signing in as <b>{{currentUserName}}</b>.
        </a>

      <p *ngIf="authenticated && selfRecovery">
        You are already signed in as <b>"{{currentUserName}}"</b>, which this recovery link
        is for. Recovering this user will remove existing passkeys and create a new one.
        If you do not need to recover this user, you can
        <a routerLink="/">continue to encrypt and decrypt data</a>.
      </p>
      <p *ngIf="authenticated && !selfRecovery">
        You are already signed in as <b>"{{currentUserName}}"</b>, but this recovery link
        is for a different user. If you start the recovery process, you will be signed
        out, the passkeys of the other user will be removed, and Quick Crypt will guide
        you in creating a new passkey for the recovered user identity.

        Ensure you are using the recovery link provided when you created your user
        credentials, then try again. If you lost both your passkey and recovery link,
        you cannot regain access to existing user credentials or decrypt
        previously encrypted data. You can create a new Quick Crypt user, but the new user
        cannot decrypt existing cipher text. If you locate the recovery link after
        creating a new user, you can use it to regain access to the original user
        credentials later.
