            This page allows you to regain access to your user identity after losing
            or damaging your Quick Crypt passkeys. Recovery removes all existing
            passkeys from Quick Crypt and creates a new one. You should also
            delete the old passkeys from your passkey management tool. Once
            your new passkey is created, you can again decrypt cipher text
            using your encryption passwords.

                  you in creating a new passkey for the recovered user identity.

            Ensure you are using the recovery link provided when you created your user
            credentials, then try again. If you lost both your passkey and recovery link,
            you cannot regain access to the user credentials or decrypt
            previously encrypted data. You may create a new Quick Crypt user to encrypt
            new data. If you locate the recovery link after creating a new user, you can
            use it to regain access to the original user later.
