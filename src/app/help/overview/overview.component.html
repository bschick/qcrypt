    <h1>Quick Crypt Overview</h1>

    <p>Quick Crypt was created to make it safe and convientent for you to encrypt sensitive data
      for storage in potentially insecure locations.
      For example, storing confidential information in note taking applications, planning tools, or other
      unencrypted locations is convenient but risky. The creator of Quick Crypt wanted
      to store sensitve information in a note taking application and not be limited
      to the few tools that provide end-to-end encryption. Even systems that support
      encryption often do not define their protocols, making them hard to trust.
      Installable opensource encryptions tools are an option, but they tend to be tedious to use
      and remember. Good encryption that you don't use isn't all that good in the end.</p>

    <p>Thus Quick Crypt: A small-batch text focused cipher tool designed to be Trustworthy,
      Convenient, Easy to Use, and Secure. Quick Crypt encrypts and decrypts text with a password
      you provide, using cryptographic features built into modern browsers to ensure that
      your password and clear text <b>do not unexpectedly traverse the internet.</b> After
      loading Quick Crypt,
      you could disable all network access and continue encrypting and decypting data.
      In addition to passwords you supply, Quick Crypt uses Passkeys to make it very difficult
      for an untrusted website to trick you into decrypting and exposing data unintentionally.</p>

    <p>Quick Crypt was designed to protect data that you want to store in a location that is
      not fully trusted or secure and to make it easy to securely decrypt
      that data without needing to remember or install complicated tools. Quick Crypt
      cipher text can link directly to the decryption page, so you only need
      your Passkey and the password you used for encyption. Fully understanding how Quick Crypt
      works is not necessary to use it, but if you interested
      the <a href="/help/protocol">protocol is documented</a> and the
      <a href="https://github.com/bschick/qcrypt" target="_blank">code is opensource</a> under the
      MIT license. Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

    <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Unencrypted data and passwords do not leave the browser</li>
      <li>Easy to use and hard to screw up</li>
      <li>Customizable encryption options constrained to values known to be strong</li>
      <li>Implementation follows current cryptographic best practices</li>
      <li>Convienient browser based "app" that works across modern devices</li>
      <li>After sign in, work fully offline</li>
      <li>Use the strongest web-app security practices (csp, strong cert, sri, hsts, xfo, etc..)</li>
      <li>Opensource for peer review</li>
      <li>Well specificed protocols</li>
      <li>No adverts or cookies</li>
    </ul>
