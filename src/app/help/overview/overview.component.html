    <h1>Quick Crypt: <i>Easy, Trustworthy Personal Encryption</i></h1>
    <p>We created Quick Crypt to make it safe and convenient to encrypt sensitive
      data you want to store in insecure locations. Storing confidential information
      in note taking applications, planning services, online documents, or similar
      tools is convenient but risky. Quick Crypt's primary author wanted to store
      sensitive information in a note taking application and not be limited to the
      few services that provide end-to-end encryption. Even services that support
      encryption typically do not define their protocols, making them hard to trust.
      Installable open-source encryption tools are powerful and trustworthy, but
      tedious to use and remember. Strong encryption that you don't use isn't all
      that good in the end.
    </p>
    <p>Thus, Quick Crypt. A small-batch text-focused cipher tool designed to be
      easy to use, trustworthy, and convenient. It encrypts and decrypts data using
      cryptographic features available in modern browsers to ensure your
      <b>confidential data never leaves your system</b>. After sign-in, Quick Crypt
      continues to work even with network access disabled. AEAD ciphers, passwords
      you supply, and passkey-protected credentials deliver privacy, integrity,
      authenticity, and website forgery protection.
    </p>
    <p>We designed Quick Crypt to make it easy to encrypt data and to decrypt that
      data days or years later without needing to remember or install complicated
      tools. Quick Crypt's cipher armor format provides an optional reminder or
      link to the decryption page, so you only need to remember the password you
      used for encryption and have your passkey. Understanding how Quick Crypt
      works is optional, but if you are interested, the
      <a [routerLink]="'/help/protocol'">protocols are documented</a>
      and the <a href="https://github.com/bschick/qcrypt" target="_blank">code
      is open-source</a> under the MIT license. Bug reports and pull requests are
      welcome.

    <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to use and hard to screw up</li>
      <li>Nothing to install and works on most devices</li>
      <li>Unencrypted data and passwords never leave your system</li>
      <li>Encryption options constrained to secure values</li>
      <li>Follows current cryptographic best practices</li>
      <li>Well defined and <a [routerLink]="'/help/protocol'">documented protocols</a></li>
      <li>After sign-in, should work fully offline</li>
      <li>Use the latest web security protocols (csp, cors, sri, hsts, xfo, etc.)</li>
      <li>Open-source for peer review</li>
      <li>No adverts or trackers</li>
      <li>No personally identifiable information (PII) collected</li>
