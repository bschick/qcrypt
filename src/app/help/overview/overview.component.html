    <h1>Quick Crypt: <i>Easy, Trustworthy Personal Encryption</i></h1>
    <p>We created Quick Crypt to make it safe and convenient to encrypt sensitive
      data you want to store in insecure locations. Storing confidential information
      in note taking applications, planning tools, online documents, or similar
      tools is convenient but risky. Quick Crypt's primary author wanted to store
      sensitive information in a note taking application and not be limited to the
      few services that provide end-to-end encryption. Even online tools that support
      encryption often do not define their protocols, making them hard to trust.
      Installable encryption tools like OpenSSL are powerful and trustworthy but
      tedious to use, upgrade, and remember. Strong encryption that you don't use
      isn't all that good in the end.
    </p>
    <p>Thus, Quick Crypt. A small-batch cipher tool designed to be
      easy to use, trustworthy, and convenient. Just paste text or select a file you want
      to keep confidential and click the Encrypt button. Quick Crypt is built on trusted
      <a [routerLink]="'/help/faqs'" [queryParams]="{search: 'which cipher'}">
      cryptographic algorithms</a> and <a [routerLink]="'/help/protocol'">
      sound protocols</a>.
      Encryption and decryption are performed by cryptographic functions available in
      modern browsers, ensuring your <b>confidential data never leaves your system</b>.
      After sign-in, Quick Crypt works even with network access disabled. AEAD ciphers,
      passwords you supply, and passkey-protected credentials deliver privacy,
      integrity, authenticity, and website forgery protection.
    </p>
    <p>We designed Quick Crypt to make it easy to encrypt data and to decrypt that
      data days or years later without needing to remember or install complicated
      tools. Quick Crypt's cipher armor format provides an optional reminder or
      link to the decryption page, so you only need to remember the password you
      used for encryption and have your passkey. Understanding how Quick Crypt
      works is optional, but if you are interested, the
      <a [routerLink]="'/help/protocol'">protocols are documented</a>, many
      <a [routerLink]="'/help/faqs'">questions are answered</a>,
      and the <a href="https://github.com/bschick/qcrypt" target="_blank">code
      is open source</a> under the MIT license. Bug reports and pull requests are
      welcome.

    <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to use and hard to screw up</li>
      <li>Optimized for encrypting your own data rather than for sharing</li>
      <li>Nothing to install, and works on most devices</li>
      <li>Unencrypted data and passwords never leave your system</li>
      <li>Encryption options constrained to secure values</li>
      <li>Follows current cryptographic best practices</li>
      <li>Well defined and <a [routerLink]="'/help/protocol'">documented protocols</a></li>
      <li>After sign-in, works fully offline</li>
      <li>Uses the latest web security protocols (csp, cors, sri, hsts, xfo, etc.)</li>
      <li>Open source for peer review</li>
      <li>No adverts or trackers</li>
      <li>No personally identifiable information (PII) collected</li>
