            <p>Quick Crypt was design for encytpion, storage, and decryption of your own data rather
                than for sharing of secure data. Data can only be decrypted by someone
                who has both the password used for encryption and the same Quick Crypt Passkey. While
                Passkeys are not designed for sharing, they certainly could be shared. So although
                not design for secret sharing, you can accomplish that by exporing the Quick Crypt
                Passkey from your Passkey managment tool and sharing that with an intended recipient.
