      <li>Which Crypto function implementation are used?</li>
      <p>
        Quick Crypt uses well established cryptographic functions implementeed by web browsers and libsodium.
        All cryptographic funcitons are run in the browser, ensuring that you unencrypted data remains local.
        These are the cryptographic functions used by Quick Crypt and where they are implmented. SubtleCrypte
        means the function is implented by your browser vendor (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc).

      <li>How should I chose which cipher mode to use?</li>
      <p>
        First, Quick Crypt provides only widely used, well documented, and trusted
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption" target="_blank">AEAD authenticated encryption</a>
          modes.
          AEAD ciphers provide both privacy and authenticity. None are known to be broken, even by governments, although
          that is of course hard to
          know. All are currently safe, and selecting which mode to use depends on your criteria.
          If you want the "safest" mode, the <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/aead"
            target="_blank">libsodium project recommends</a> first <b>AEGIS 256</b>, then <b>XChaCha20 Poly1305</b>, and
          <b>AES 256 GCM</b> last
          If you want a mode implemented by your browser vendor, use <b>AES 256 GCM</b>
          If you want a mode not implemented by your browser vendor, use <b>XChaCha20 Poly1305</b> or <b>AEGIS 256</b>
          which are from the well known open source <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/" target="_blank">libsodium
            project</a>
          If you really don't trust your browser vendor, you probably shouldn't use Quick Crypt at all
          If you want the most recently developed mode, use <b>AEGIS 256</b>
          If you want the most established (and studied) mode, use <b>AES 256 GCM</b> which is at the core of TLS 1.3
          If you want the smallest cipher text (by only 16 character), use <b>AES 256 GCM</b>

      <li>Can I used Quick Crypt with text or binary files?</li>
      <li>Can I decrypt my data if Quick Crypt goes away?</li>
      <li>Can Quick Crypt decrypt cipher text encypted with other tools?</li>
      <li>Why do I need a passkey to use Quick Crypt?</li>
      <li>Is the 'link' Cipher Armor format secure?</li>
      <li>What does Quick Crypt know and track about me?</li>
      <p>Quick Crypt never asks for Personal Identifiable Information (PII). To prevent impersonation
        by untrusted site that could try to trick you into exposing clear text data, Quick Crypt
        uses passkeys. To help you track the passkey Quick Crypt asks for a user name, but that can
        can be any value you want. Your use name does not need to be an email address and serves
        only to help you associate that passkey with Quick Crypt.
      </p>
      <li>Can I have more than one user account or passkey?</li>
      <p>Yes to both. Once signed in, you can create additional passkeys from the slide out
        panel opened with the 3-line button in the toolbar. From the slide out panel you can also
        sign out in order to create a new user identity with a new passkey. To reduce the load on
        Quick Crypt, we ask that you only create as many users and passkeys as truly
        needed. Identities that look like abuse may be purged.
      </p>
      <li>How do I remove passkeys?</li>
      <p>Once signed in, you can delete passkey references from the slide out
        panel opened with the 3-line button in the toolbar. This will remove
        information about the passkey from the Quick Crypt server. To delete the
        actual passkey, you must use your own passkey managment tool.
      </p>
      <li>How do I remove my user identity entirely?</li>
      <p>Once signed in, delete all passkeys references from the slide out
        panel opened with the 3-line button in the toolbar. When you delete the
        last passkey reference, your user identity will also be removed from the
        Quick Crypt Server. Once removed you will not be able to use Quick Crypt
        to decrypt previously encypted messages with the removed user identity.
        This is not reversable, even with the recovery link. Remember to also delete
        the actual passkeys using your own passkey managment tool.
      </p>

      <li>I have read web applications should not be trusted for encryption</li>
      <li>Does Quick Crypt track my identity or contact information?</li>
      <li>Can I used Quick Crypt to send encrypted information to other people?</li>
      <p>Quick Crypt was design for encytpion, storage, and decryption of your own data rather
        than for sharing of secure data. Data can only be decrypted by someone
        who has both the password used for encryption and the same Quick Crypt Passkey. While
        Passkeys are not designed for sharing, they certainly could be shared. So although
        not design for secret sharing, you can accomplish that by exporing a passkey
        from your passkey managment tool and sharing that with your intended recipient.
      </p>
      <li>Can I trust the 3rd party liibraries used by Quick Crypte?</li>
      <p>Bundled rather than downloaded
        All open source, actively developed, widely used packages
      </p>
