      <li>
        First, ensure your internet connection is working. If you have a good connection
        and have previously used Quick Crypt, select the passkey you used when
        you first signed in. You may have created a passkey with a
        physical key, a mobile device, or a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password.
      </li>

      <li>If you lost or damaged your passkeys, take one of these actions:

        <ul class="inner-steps">
          <li><a [routerLink]="'/recovery2'" (click)="onClickRecovery2($event)">Restore access to your account</a>
            using the recovery words provided when you created your account. Just
            follow the link above and enter your recovery word pattern.</li>
          <li>If you created an account before Quick Crypt switched to recovery words,
            locate the <b>recovery link</b> that was provided
            when you created your account. Then paste that link into your browser's
            address bar and press Enter.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you lost both your Quick Crypt passkeys and recovery information, you cannot
        access your existing user identity to decrypt or encrypt data. To continue using
        Quick Crypt, you may <a [routerLink]="'/newuser'" (click)="onClickNewUser($event)">
        create a new account</a>.
        If you find your original recovery information or passkey, you can use either to
        regain access to your account and decrypt data.
      </li>
      <li>
