    <p>
      First, make sure your internet connection is working. If you are connected and
      have previously used Quick Crypt, just select the passkey you used when
      you first signed in. You may have created a passkey with a
      physical key, a mobile device, or a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password.
      If you lost or damaged your passkey, follow these recovery steps:
    </p>

    <ol class="steps" type="1">
      <li>Locate the <b>recovery link</b> provided when you created your user
        identity and first passkey. You may have also accessed your recovery link
        from the credentials side panel.</li>
      <li>Paste that link into your browser's address bar and hit enter.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you lost both your Quick Crypt passkeys and recovery link, you cannot
      access your existing user identity to decrypt or encrypt data. To continue using
      Quick Crypt, you must create a new user identity. The new user cannot decrypt
      existing cipher text, however. If you find your original recovery link or passkey
      later, you can use either to regain access to your original user identity and
      decrypt and encrypt data.
