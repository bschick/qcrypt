      <li>Locate the <b>recovery link</b> that was provided to you when you created your user 
        identity and first passkey or that you copied from the credentials side panel</li>
      <li>Paste that link into your browser's address bar and hit enter</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you have lost both your Quick Crypt passkeys and recovery link, there is no way to regain
      access to your existing user identity or decrypt data that you previously encrypted. 
      To encrypt and decrypt more data, you can create a new Quick Crypt user. If you locate
      your recovery link leter, you can use it anytime to regain acccess to your original
      user identity.
