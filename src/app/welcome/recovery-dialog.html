    <p>
      If you have previously used Quick Crypt, locate the passkey created when
      you first sign in. Your passkey may be derived from a physical key,
      mobile device, or password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password. To sign in again
      you need to present that same passkey on this system. If you no longer have your passkey,
      follow the recovery steps below.
    </p>

    <ol class="steps" type="1">
      <li>Locate the <b>recovery link</b> that was provided when you created your user
        identity and first passkey. You may have also copied the recovery link from
        the credentials side panel</li>
      <li>Paste that link into your browser's address bar and hit enter</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you lost both your Quick Crypt passkeys and recovery link, there is no way to regain
      access to your existing user identity to decrypt data that you previously encrypted.
      To encrypt and decrypt new data, you can create a new Quick Crypt user. If you find
      your original recovery link or passkey later, you can use either to regain
      acccess to your original user identity anytime.
