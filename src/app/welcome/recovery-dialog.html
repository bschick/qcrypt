        First, make sure your internet connection is working. If you are connected and
        have previously used Quick Crypt, just select the passkey you used when
        you first signed in. You may have created a passkey with a
        physical key, a mobile device, or a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password.
      </li>

      <li> If you lost or damaged your passkey, follow these steps:
        <ul class="inner-steps">
          <li>Locate the <b>recovery link</b> provided when you created your user
            identity and first passkey. You may have also accessed your recovery link
            from the credentials side panel.</li>
          <li>Paste that link into your browser's address bar and hit enter.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you lost both your Quick Crypt passkeys and recovery link, you cannot
        access your existing user identity to decrypt or encrypt data. To continue using
        Quick Crypt, you may <a [routerLink]="'/newuser'" (click)="onClickNewUser($event)">
          create a new user identity</a>.
        If you find your original recovery link or passkey, you can use either to
        regain access to your original identity and decrypt data.
      </li>
      <li>
