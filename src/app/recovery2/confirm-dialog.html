    You are signed in as <b>"{{currentUserName}}"</b>, but this recovery
    pattern is for a different user. If you continue the recovery process, you will
    be signed out, the passkeys of the other user will be removed, and Quick Crypt
    will create a new passkey for the recovered user identity.
    <br /><br />
    Continue with recovery?
