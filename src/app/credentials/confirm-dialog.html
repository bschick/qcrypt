    This is the passkey you used to sign-in to Quick Crypt. Once removed,
    the passkey cannot be added back and you should also delete it
    from your passkey managment tool. You may continue accessing Quick Crypt
    with your remaining passkeys.<br /><br />

  <div *ngIf="pkState==LAST_PK" class="message" mat-dialog-content>
    Deleting your only passkey will remove your entire user identify and
    you will not be able to decrypt previously encypted data with the
    Quick Crypt website. Removing this passkey and user identify are
    irriversable and your recovery link will only work with command-line tools.
    If you proceed, also delete this passkey from your passkey managment tool.<br /><br />
    To continue, type '{{userName}}' then click Yes.
