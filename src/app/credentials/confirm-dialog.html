  <div *ngIf="pkState==NONE_PK" class="message" mat-dialog-content>
    Once removed, this passkey will no longer identify you with Quick Crypt.
    The passkey cannot be added back and you should also delete it
    from your passkey managment tool. You may continue accessing Quick Crypt
    with your remaining passkeys.<br /><br />
    Continue with passkey removal?
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="pkState==ACTIVE_PK" class="message" mat-dialog-content>
    This is the passkey you used to sign in to Quick Crypt. Once removed,
    the passkey cannot be added back and you should also delete it
    from your passkey managment tool. You may continue accessing Quick Crypt
    with your remaining passkeys.<br /><br />
    Continue with passkey removal?
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="pkState==LAST_PK" class="message" mat-dialog-content>
    Since this is your only passkey, removing it will remove your entire Quick
    Crypt user identify and you will not be able to decrypt previously encypted data.
    Removing this passkey and user identify are irriversable and your recovery
    link will not work.<br /><br />
    To continue, type "confirm" then click Yes.
