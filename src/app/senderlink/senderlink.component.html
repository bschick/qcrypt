    <h1>Creat Sender Link</h1>
    <p>
      A sender link allows others to encrypt data that only you can decrypt.
      Set the values belows and click the "Create Link" button to generate a
      new sender link. You can share this link with others who can than encrypt
      text and files that only you can decrypt. Unlike many online encryption
      services, Quick Crypt never stores your encypted or decrypted data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Keep this recovery link private</b>. While another
      person with this link cannot decrypt your data without the passwords
      you used during encryption, they could delete your Quick Crypt account
      making it less convenient to decrypt your data.
      So be sure to keep this link private.
    </p>
