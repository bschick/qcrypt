    Quick Crypt encrypts and decrypts text using a password you provide. Quick
    Crypt uses cryptographic features built into modern browsers, ensuring that
    your password, clear text, and even encrypted cipher text
    <b>do not unexpectedly traverse the internet.</b> A typical use is to
    encrypt text before storing or sending it through an untrusted channel. Your
    original text can only be retrieved by someone who knows your password.
    Remember your password, or you won't be able to retrieve the original text
    either.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use Quick Crypt, paste or upload the text you want to be encrypted in the
    field on the left labeled <i>Enter Clear Text</i>, then click the
    <b>Encrypt</b> button and enter a password. You can enter an optional
    password hint to remind yourself which password you used. The hint is stored
    in the clear with the encrypted text, so don't make it too revealing. The
    encrypted results are displayed to the right and can be copied or saved to
    disk. To decrypt information previously encrypted with Quick Crypt, paste or
    open the encrypted text in the field on the right labeled
    <i>Enter Cipher Text</i> and click the <b>Decrypt</b> button. If you've
    forgotten your password, you are out of luck unless you have access to a
    supercomputer and time to spare.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can customize some of Quick Crypt's functionality by opening the
    <i>Advanced Encryptions Options</i> panel and making changes. Other than
    your password choice, Quick Crypt does not provide options known to be
    insecure, so adjusting settings should be safe. If you want even more
    security, you can encrypt something multiple times with the
    <i>Loop Encrypt</i> option; just be sure to use a different password for
    each loop.
